            <p>I, <strong>{{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }}</strong>, understand
                that I have a
                right to expect
                freedom from sexual, racial, or other forms of harassment or displays of prejudice. I also
                understand
                that this type of behavior or harassment is not acceptable of me as a Illinois Computer Science Sail
                participant.
                I realize that the guidelines listed below are not the only ones that may be enforced during the
                Retreat.
            </p>
            <p>As a Illinois Computer Science Sail participant, I will be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a team member and share creativity and knowledge with others in the group.</li>
                <li>inquisitive and informed if I have any concerns during the program.</li>
                <li>respectful towards Illinois Computer Science Sail staff.</li>
                <li>well-mannered; I will not behave in a way that will endanger myself or others.</li>
                <li>helpful towards the Illinois Computer Science Sail staff by leaving group activities only in the
                    company of a
                    Illinois Computer Science Sail staff and by listening to their advice.
                </li>
                <li>proactive in looking after my own safety by notifying a Illinois Computer Science Sail staff member
                    about my
                    whereabouts at all times when Iâ€™m not with the group.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a Illinois Computer Science Sail program participant, I agree to follow the above guidelines and rules
                of the 2020 Illinois Computer Science Sail program. I am aware that if I choose not to follow these guidelines I
                may risk dismissal from the program.
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, I understand that I am participating in the Illinois Computer Science Sail program on
                Saturday, April 4, 2020 with the assumption of risk at any academic or social event during the week. I will not
                hold Illinois Computer Science Sail responsible for any accidents within my control.
